# Asteroids

This game was created using Python. In it, the player will maneuver a spacecraft around the screen shooting asteroids. The goal is to destroy all of the asteroids coming at the spacecraft without dying. The user will be given 3 lives to begin with. Each time an asteroid hits the spacecraft, the player will lose a life. When an asteroid is hit, the player scores points and the asteroid splits into smaller asteroids. The largest asteroids are worth 20 points. Each medium asteroid is worth 50 points. The smallest asteroids are worth 100 points each. When the spacecraft hits a small asteroid it is obliterated into dust and it disappears completely from the game.

# Features
In the original game, there were flying saucers that would periodically appear. These UFOs would shoot at the ship and if the ship fired back and blew one up, there were 200 points awarded for hitting a large UFO and 1000 points awarded for blowing up a small UFO.
